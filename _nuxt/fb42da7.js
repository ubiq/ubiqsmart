In order to send a transaction on Ubiq or Ethereum, you need UBQ or ETH for gas. So if the gas for a withdrawal is linked to you, then so is the withdrawal itself.</p><p>This raises an obvious problem: you need private gas money to initiate a withdrawal, but you need an Enmaku withdrawal to get that private gas money. This catch-22 is resolved with relayers.</p><p>Relayers are services run by others for a fee that initiate a withdrawal on your behalf when you don’t have the private gas to initiate it yourself. If you have an empty wallet and some deposits to withdraw, you’d use a relayer to withdraw some UBQ deposits for gas, so you can use a wallet to withdraw your remaining deposits.</p><h4>Relayer Select</h4><p>You can open Relayer Select View by clicking on the Change button next to Relayer: <strong>None</strong>.</p><p><em>The default relayer each time the app starts is None, which means your wallet will initiate the withdrawal. You must manually change this each time the app starts to prevent any network calls outside the host and RPC without you explicitly initiating them.</em></p><p>You’ll see a list of relayers and their URLs.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6N1U4yki98bjbVeA4wzCNQ.png\\" /></figure><p><em>Each relayer’s status can be found at its base URL and contains information regarding fees, gas price, supported tokens, and version.</em></p><p>To ping a cell and fetch its status data, you can click on the relayer’s cell. You can also click “Batch ping all” to fetch them all and sort by fee.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p-e1MEWAG2ehBQ0EoBFi2A.png\\" /></figure><p>In the upper right hand corner, you’ll see the relayer’s Supported Tokens. You can also hover over the token icon to reveal which specific pools are supported.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/1*Kv0d32abfVeX8zT1tHpIBg.png\\" /></figure><p>In the lower half of the cell, you’ll find the relayer’s base fee percentage and gas price for each withdrawal.</p><p><em>Because gas is a constant and fee percentage is a scalar, the “cheapest” relayer will depend on which amounts are being withdrawn.</em></p><p><em>For example, if a relayer’s gas price is 0.01 UBQ and its fee is 1%, a 1000 UBQ withdrawal will end up costing 10.01 UBQ (1.001%) while a 10 UBQ withdrawal will cost .11 UBQ (1.1%).</em></p><p><em>Since the amount distribution of your notes can affect which relayer is cheapest, after you’ve validated some notes, you’ll find additional fee calculations for your withdrawal in the cell too, and relayers will then be sorted by those.</em></p><p>Once you’ve selected a relayer, click on the back button to return to Withdrawal.</p><p><strong>Note Validation</strong></p><p>Back in Withdrawal, enter a few notes you used to deposit UBQ into the input panel.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogwCAsISwe1RaW9K5p9Vg.png\\" /></figure><p>Click on the validate button, and Enmaku will ensure the notes are valid and in the pool.</p><p><em>When Enmaku validates your notes, it first checks that each note’s format is correct, then fetches a list of all the pool’s past deposit events to find yours. This is for two reasons. 1: When Enmaku generates the withdrawal proof using the note, it needs to construct the deposit’s Merkle tree to find the path, so all the deposits are required. 2: If you only fetch your* note’s deposit with an external RPC, the RPC can know which deposit is yours when you do anything with it. The entire event history is retrieved every time, not just when withdrawing, for these reasons.</em></p><p>The first time you validate a pool’s note, it may take a while to download the event history, but since that history is then cached in the browser, subsequent downloads will be much faster.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EBwo-z7fhomILsBm3pvt9A.png\\" /></figure><p>You should see a status of <strong>[Found in pool]</strong> for your notes, but if you don’t, it’ll be for 1 of 7 reasons:</p><ul><li>Wrong token: Enmaku will only withdraw one token at a time. The selected ‘withdrawal token’ corresponds with the first valid note in your list.

In order to send a transaction on Ubiq or Ethereum, you need UBQ or ETH for gas. So if the gas for a withdrawal is linked to you, then so is the withdrawal itself.\\nThis raises an obvious problem: you need private gas money to initiate a withdrawal, but you need an Enmaku withdrawal to get that private gas money. This catch-22 is resolved with relayers.\\nRelayers are services run by others for a fee that initiate a withdrawal on your behalf when you don’t have the private gas to initiate it yourself. If you have an empty wallet and some deposits to withdraw, you’d use a relayer to withdraw some UBQ deposits for gas, so you can use a wallet to withdraw your remaining deposits.\\nRelayer Select\\nYou can open Relayer Select View by clicking on the Change button next to Relayer: None.\\nThe default relayer each time the app starts is None, which means your wallet will initiate the withdrawal. You must manually change this each time the app starts to prevent any network calls outside the host and RPC without you explicitly initiating them.\\nYou’ll see a list of relayers and their URLs.\\n\\nEach relayer’s status can be found at its base URL and contains information regarding fees, gas price, supported tokens, and version.\\nTo ping a cell and fetch its status data, you can click on the relayer’s cell. You can also click “Batch ping all” to fetch them all and sort by fee.\\n\\nIn the upper right hand corner, you’ll see the relayer’s Supported Tokens. You can also hover over the token icon to reveal which specific pools are supported.\\n\\nIn the lower half of the cell, you’ll find the relayer’s base fee percentage and gas price for each withdrawal.\\nBecause gas is a constant and fee percentage is a scalar, the “cheapest” relayer will depend on which amounts are being withdrawn.\\nFor example, if a relayer’s gas price is 0.01 UBQ and its fee is 1%, a 1000 UBQ withdrawal will end up costing 10.01 UBQ (1.001%) while a 10 UBQ withdrawal will cost .11 UBQ (1.1%).\\nSince the amount distribution of your notes can affect which relayer is cheapest, after you’ve validated some notes, you’ll find additional fee calculations for your withdrawal in the cell too, and relayers will then be sorted by those.\\nOnce you’ve selected a relayer, click on the back button to return to Withdrawal.\\nNote Validation\\nBack in Withdrawal, enter a few notes you used to deposit UBQ into the input panel.\\n\\nClick on the validate button, and Enmaku will ensure the notes are valid and in the pool.\\nWhen Enmaku validates your notes, it first checks that each note’s format is correct, then fetches a list of all the pool’s past deposit events to find yours. This is for two reasons. 1: When Enmaku generates the withdrawal proof using the note, it needs to construct the deposit’s Merkle tree to find the path, so all the deposits are required. 2: If you only fetch your* note’s deposit with an external RPC, the RPC can know which deposit is yours when you do anything with it. The entire event history is retrieved every time, not just when withdrawing, for these reasons.\\nThe first time you validate a pool’s note, it may take a while to download the event history, but since that history is then cached in the browser, subsequent downloads will be much faster.\\n\\nYou should see a status of [Found in pool] for your notes, but if you don’t, it’ll be for 1 of 7 reasons:\\n\\nWrong token: Enmaku will only withdraw one token at a time. The selected ‘withdrawal token’ corresponds with the first valid note in your list. If you attempt to validate a valid UBQ and a valid ESCH note in that order, the ESCH note will show [Wrong token], and you’ll need to withdraw it in a separate withdrawal.\\nInvalid note format: The note didn’t pass the regex and is incorrectly formatted. Ensure the note is entered exactly how Enmaku first displayed it.\\nUnsupported token: The token symbol wasn’t found in the app, and you may need to add it.\\nUnsupported amount: The token symbol was found in the app, but the pool’s amount was not.\\nWrong chain ID: The note’s chain ID is incorrect, and you may be using the wrong interface.\\nNever deposited: The note’s format is fine, but its associated deposit was not found in the pool.\\nAlready withdrawn: The note has been spent.\\n\\nIf you selected a relayer and validated some notes, you’ll notice a drop card under the Withdraw card, displaying exactly how much will go to the relayer. These numbers are based on the gas price and fee for your valid notes’ amount distribution.\\nOut of 4 UBQ, 3.9 will be withdrawn to you, and the remaining 0.1 will be sent to the relayer for fee and gas\\nClick on the relayer’s change button again to view the relayer cells.\\n\\nThe bottom half now also has the total percentage fee for your withdrawal as well as how many & which of your withdrawals are supported by the relayer.\\nAs with supported tokens, you can hover over “Total Supported Withdrawals” to view which of yours are supported.\\n\\nFor the sake of explanation, we selected a relayer before validating our notes, but bear in mind that Enmaku will sort relayers by whichever is cheapest given all the information it has, including validated notes.\\nSo if you’re using a relayer, it makes more sense to validate your notes, then ping relayers to choose the cheapest from there.\\nRelayer Withdrawal\\nFinally, create a new account in Sparrow or MetaMask and copy the address.\\n\\nPaste the address into the destination field.\\n\\nClick on withdraw. A confirmation modal will open.\\n\\nOnce you confirm your withdrawal, your notes will be used to compute proofs that demonstrate you’re entitled to your original deposits.\\n\\nTo keep on-chain verification costs low, proof generation requires more computation off-chain, so it may take up to ~10 seconds to generate each note’s proof.\\nAs proofs are generated, they’ll be sent to the relayer, and you will receive transaction hashes if they were successful.\\n\\nAnd once again, just as with the deposit, we can click on “Complete this withdrawal” in the modal to clear the withdrawal session.\\n\\nOnce they’re confirmed, you’ll see your updated balance in your wallet, minus the relayer fee and gas costs.\\n\\nWallet Withdrawal\\nNow that we’ve used a relayer to withdraw private UBQ for gas, we can use that UBQ to wallet-withdraw our remaining notes! Connect your wallet, then validate your notes.\\n\\nUnless you refreshed the page, a relayer should still be selected from your last withdraw. So to withdraw with a wallet this time, click on change and select None under relayers.\\n\\nClick on the back button and enter the destination.

confirmations.\\n\\nOnce they’re confirmed, you’ll see your updated balance in your wallet!\\nYou can now use your UBQ to withdraw your ESCH in the same way, using either a wallet or a relayer.\\nIn the next post, we’ll dive into Enmaku’s note management system, and take a look at the notes we’ve been saving by choosing “Yes” in the deposit & withdraw modals.\\nThanks for checking in and be sure
