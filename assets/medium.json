You can see your currently staked LP tokens and any unharvested tokens that you have been farming.\nUpdated with wallet information since signing in with Sparrow. Currently, I have no Staked tokens and unharvested TGE1s.\nAt the top right-hand side of the screen, the Unlock Wallet button has also been replaced with ‘View Balances’.\nView Balances in place of Unlock Wallet.\nIf you click ‘View Balances’ you can see your currently harvested tokens gained from farming your SLPT. You can also ‘Sign Out’ from Sparrow here if you wish, or click cancel to go back to the primary screen and continue with this guide.\nYour current harvested balance from Yield Farming.\nNext we will stake some SLPT to start farming those yields!\nStaking LP Tokens\nPlease note, some users have tried to send SLPT tokens directly to the contract address instead of following the steps in this guide. If you do this, your funds will not be recoverable. Please always follow the guide or ask the Ubiq community in Discord if you are uncertain on the process.\nOn the left-hand box on the screen there is a summary of your currently staked tokens. Click the ‘Stake’ box to provide some.\nClick the right-hand Stake button.\nThen, the Stake screen will pop-up. This will tell you how much SLPT you have available for staking. Here there are 10 ESCH-UBQ SLPT available. You can either select the maximum amount for staking or select your own quantity. In the below example we provided 5 for staking. Click ‘Stake’ when you have selected the amount you wish to provide.\nThe Stake summary page.\nSparrow will then pop-up to confirm that you wish to Stake. Click the Confirm button.\nSparrow asking for confirmation of staking SLPT\nOnce you have clicked the confirm button, wait for the transaction to confirm in the next block. In the meantime, the Stake button will have changed to ‘Staking…’ whilst we wait.\nWaiting for the transaction to confirm.\nOnce processed, the balance of staked tokens will update and you still have the option of staking more, or unstaking your tokens now becomes available.\nThe updated Staking Screen.\nHarvesting your Generated Tokens\nNow your tokens are staked, you will earn newly generated tokens for each new block found. The amount of tokens you receive is based on the issuance model per block, divided by your stake as a percentage of the total SLPT provided by all participants.\nFor example, if 100 new tokens are created per-block and you have 10% of the SLPT currently staked, you will receive 10 new tokens, with the remaining 90 going to the other participants.\nAs you accrue your tokens, your ‘Unharvested’ total will increase. There is no time limit on harvesting these tokens and they stay reserved for you until you decide to click the ‘Harvest’ button.\nYour currently unharvested tokens.\nOnce you click harvest, Sparrow will pop up to confirm the transaction. Click the confirm button.\nConfirmation of harvesting tokens in Sparrow.\nWhilst we wait for the next block to be found and the transaction to be processed, the Harvest button will change to ‘Harvesting…’.\nHarvesting in process.\nThen once the next block is found, the Unharvested tokens will not display any balance as they have now been added to the harvested balance number.\nNo Unharvested tokens remaining.\nNow when you click on View Balance, your harvested token total will be updated with your new tokens.\nUpdated balance.\nUnstaking LP Tokens\nNext, we will cover the concept of Unstaking your SLPT.\nUnstaking removes your SLPT from the yield farming process, reducing or removing entirely the amount of new tokens you will harvest.\nClick the Unstake button to continue.\nThe currently staked SLPT tokens, ready to be unstaked.\nNext you will have a popup, displaying how many tokens are currently staked and a field to select how many you wish to unstake. You can also click Max if you would like to remove everything. Click ‘Unstake’ when you are ready to proceed.\nUnstaking SLPT from the farming process.\nThe usual Sparrow confirmation will pop up, click confirm, and the Unstake button will change to ‘Unstaking…’ pending confirmation of the transaction.\nUnstaking pending confirmation.\nOnce the transaction confirms your balance will update and you may now use all buttons as normal again.\nUpdated LP token balance\nLastly, the Harvest & Unstake button will remove all SLPT and generated tokens from the platform. Click the below button and then confirm the transaction in Sparrow as normal.\nThe Harvest & Unstake button\nOnce the transaction has confirmed, all balances will be updated to 0.\nEmpty balances as all SLPT has been unstaked and tokens harvested.\nAnd that is it! Please drop into the Ubiq discord if you have any questions.\nHappy Farming!\n\nUsing Shinobi — Yield Farming and Token Generation Events was originally published in The Ubiq Report on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

It can seem trite. After all, “<em>decentralization</em>” has long been a prevailing buzzword of the wider cryptocurrency industry. Sometimes it’s platitudes, while in other cases it reflects an actual ethos that some projects strive toward. Ubiq is undoubtedly the latter.</p><p>In 2020, a significant addition to the Ubiq sphere was <a href=\"https://shinobi.ubiq.ninja/swap\">Shinobi</a>. A custom code-fork of <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Uniswap V2</a>, it is a foundational component needed to open the chain to wider interoperability. With its introduction, there is now a familiar and <em>permission-less</em> way to maneuver between UBQ and the various tokens that are utilizing the Ubiq chain.</p><p>There is much more on the horizon for Ubiq’s <a href=\"https://blog.ubiqsmart.com/the-ubiq-dex-liquidity-pools-6b1b1982c30a\">AMM</a>, but since we are talking decentralization here, let’s do something practical.</p><p>In previous guides we have shown how to maintain a full node for Ubiq on inexpensive single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi.

It can seem trite. After all, “decentralization” has long been a prevailing buzzword of the wider cryptocurrency industry. Sometimes it’s platitudes, while in other cases it reflects an actual ethos that some projects strive toward. Ubiq is undoubtedly the latter.\nIn 2020, a significant addition to the Ubiq sphere was Shinobi. A custom code-fork of Uniswap V2, it is a foundational component needed to open the chain to wider interoperability. With its introduction, there is now a familiar and permission-less way to maneuver between UBQ and the various tokens that are utilizing the Ubiq chain.\nThere is much more on the horizon for Ubiq’s AMM, but since we are talking decentralization here, let’s do something practical.\nIn previous guides we have shown how to maintain a full node for Ubiq on inexpensive single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi. We have also shown how to use a web3 wallet like Sparrow or Metamask to route transactions through those nodes.\nThe logic for Shinobi lives on-chain in the form of smart contracts and therefore exists within the storage of all full nodes. The portion of the system that exists off-chain is the graphical interface. Wider distribution of which can benefit the whole network; just like the nodes themselves.\nSince 2021 appears to be the year that AMM’s will become truly dominant, it is important that if we tout our permission-less bonafides that we continue to expound upon the tools to achieve it.\nSo, let’s install and use the Shinobi interface from the same hardware on which we are running our nodes!\nDepending how your system is configured, either use ssh to gain access or input the commands directly.\nLog in as the default user.\nFor example —\nUser pi if you are using Raspberry Pi OS.\nUser root if you are using Armbian.\nBe sure to have changed the default password.\nInput the commands —\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maaatttt/ubiq/master/shinobi.sh\nsudo chmod +x shinobi.sh\n./shinobi.sh\nIf prompted, respond to questions during the install with y or yes.\nMake note of the IP address information, including the port number (8888) when it is displayed upon completion of the setup.
