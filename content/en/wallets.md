## Software

<wallet-card wallet-id="metamask" href="https://metamask.io">
MetaMask provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. You are always in control when interacting on the new decentralized web. MetaMask generates passwords and keys on your device, so only you have access to your accounts and data. You always choose what to share and what to keep private.

Sparrow equips you with a key vault, secure login and token wallet — everything you need to manage your digital assets. It is the recommended hot wallet for dApp interactions, providing the most simple and secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. You can also use Sparrow to interact with hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger.

Pyrus is a browser-based, client-side Ubiq wallet. You can generate wallets that are completely client-side, easily send Ubiq, ERC-20 standard tokens (e.g. GEO, ESCH), generate and send offline transactions - all while your private keys never touch an internet-connected device.

Bringing together all of your accounts, assets and application interfaces, the Fusion Wallet combines all Ubiq blockchain functionality into one secure and powerful interface, providing a full node with all of the tools to write and deploy your own smart contracts and tokens.
