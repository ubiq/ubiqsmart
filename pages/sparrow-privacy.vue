        <p>
          <strong><em>Do we use Cookies?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or

        <p>
          <strong><em>What is a Cookie?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard
          drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later
          be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
          Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or
          select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You
          can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list
          below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional
          cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be
          used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count
          visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine
          whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive
          reports based on the use of these technologies by our
          service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Why do we use Cookies?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>We generally use Cookies for the following purposes:</p>

          <li>To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising.</li>
          <li>
            To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across
            multiple websites or other platforms.

            To better understand the interests of our customers and our website
            visitors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Site, and without
          such Cookies, we would not be able to provide many services that you
          need to properly use the Site. These Cookies, for example, allow us to
          operate our Site so you may access it as you have requested and let us
          recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that
          account to access Site content. They also include Cookies that enable
          us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session
          and secure our Sites. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use functional Cookies and Cookies from third parties for
          analysis and marketing purposes. &nbsp;Functional Cookies enable
          certain parts of the site to work properly and your user preferences
          to remain known. &nbsp;Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect
          information on how visitors use our Site, the content and products
          that users view most frequently, and the effectiveness of our third
          party advertising. Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to
          relevant audiences and having our ads appear at the top of search
          results. Cookies are either “session” Cookies which are deleted when
          you end your browser session, or “persistent,” which remain until
          their deletion by you (discussed below) or the party who served the
          cookie. &nbsp;Full details on all of the Cookies used on the Site are

        <p><strong>LOCAL STORAGE POLICY</strong></p>
        <p>
          Local Storage, including Javascript-enabled localStorage, is a typical
